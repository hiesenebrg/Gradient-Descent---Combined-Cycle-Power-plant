A Model to get prediction of combined-cycle dataset Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset contains 9568 data <br/> points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set <br/>to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure <br/> (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.<br/> You are given:

 1.A Readme file for more details on dataset.<br/>
 2.A Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data<br/>
 3.A X test File and you have to predict and submit predictions for this file. Your task is to:<br/>
 4.Code Gradient Descent for N features and come with predictions.<br/>
 5.Try and test with various combinations of learning rates and number of iterations.<br/>
 6.Try using Feature Scaling, and see if it helps you in getting better results.<br/>
